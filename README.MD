# amethyst-archives
Repository for any modules of [Amethyst](https://github.com/ClarityMoe/Amethyst) that were removed from that main release, but were archived for learning purposes, or for those that may want them.

Modules in this repository are not 100% guaranteed to be up-to-date with the latest Amethyst version, or even fully completed. Use these at your own discretion.

Also contains modules that does not belong in the main release but we made anyway for the sake of it and need a place to store.
